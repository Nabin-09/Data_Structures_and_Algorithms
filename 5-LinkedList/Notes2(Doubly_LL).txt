PreRequisites :
In C++, `.` (dot) and `->` (arrow) are operators used to access members (attributes or methods) of objects. They are primarily used in different contexts depending on how the object or the structure is stored or referenced. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each:

### The `.` Operator

- **Context**: Used with an object or structure (struct) when you have a direct instance of that object or struct.
- **Usage**: `object.member` or `struct.member`
- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  struct Point {
      int x, y;
  };

  Point p;
  p.x = 10; // Using the dot operator to access and set member 'x'
  p.y = 20; // Using the dot operator to access and set member 'y'
  ```
- **Explanation**: In this example, `p` is a direct instance of `Point`. To access the members `x` and `y`, you use the `.` operator.

### The `->` Operator

- **Context**: Used with a pointer to an object or structure when you have a pointer to the instance.
- **Usage**: `pointer->member`
- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  struct Point {
      int x, y;
  };

  Point* ptr = new Point;
  ptr->x = 10; // Using the arrow operator to access and set member 'x' through a pointer
  ptr->y = 20; // Using the arrow operator to access and set member 'y' through a pointer

  delete ptr; // Remember to delete allocated memory
  ```
- **Explanation**: In this case, `ptr` is a pointer to a `Point` object. The `->` operator is used to access the members `x` and `y` through this pointer.

### Differences Between `.` and `->`

1. **Type of Access**:
   - `.` is used for accessing members of an object or struct when you have the actual instance.
   - `->` is used for accessing members of an object or struct through a pointer to that instance.

2. **Syntax and Usability**:
   - With `.` you directly access the member from the instance.
   - With `->`, the compiler automatically dereferences the pointer to access the member. It is equivalent to `(*pointer).member`.

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Instances accessed with `.` are typically allocated on the stack (automatic storage duration) unless explicitly declared otherwise.
   - Instances accessed with `->` are often dynamically allocated on the heap and require explicit memory management (using `new` and `delete`).

4. **Safety and Convenience**:
   - The dot operator (`.`) is straightforward and used with non-pointer types, hence safer in terms of dereferencing errors.
   - The arrow operator (`->`) simplifies accessing members through pointers without manually dereferencing them with `*`.

### Examples to Illustrate the Differences

#### Example 1: Using `.` with Struct

```cpp
struct Rectangle {
    int width, height;
};

Rectangle rect;
rect.width = 50;  // Directly accessing and setting width
rect.height = 100; // Directly accessing and setting height
```

#### Example 2: Using `->` with Struct Pointer

```cpp
struct Rectangle {
    int width, height;
};

Rectangle* rectPtr = new Rectangle;
rectPtr->width = 50;  // Accessing and setting width through a pointer
rectPtr->height = 100; // Accessing and setting height through a pointer

delete rectPtr; // Clean up dynamically allocated memory
```

#### Example 3: Comparing `.` and `->` with Class Objects

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    void start() {
        // Implementation
    }
};

Car myCar;
myCar.start(); // Using dot operator to call start method

Car* carPtr = new Car;
carPtr->start(); // Using arrow operator to call start method through a pointer

delete carPtr; // Clean up dynamically allocated memory
```

### Summary

- Use `.` when dealing with direct instances of an object or structure.
- Use `->` when dealing with pointers to objects or structures.

Understanding these operators is crucial for proper memory management and for writing clear, bug-free C++ code, especially when dealing with pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
DOUBLY LINKED LIST :
It points towards the next as well as points towards the previous node.
Basic structure of Doubly Linked List:
code:
class Node{
    public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node* back;
    public:
    Node(int data1,Node* next1,Node* back1){
        data = data1;
        next = next1;
        back = back1;
    }
    public:
    Node(int data1,Node* next1,Node* back1){
        data = data1;
        next1 = nullptr;
        back1 = nullptr;
    }
};
Converting Array to Doubly Linked List:
code:
Node* ConvertToLL(vector<int> &arr){
    Node* head = new Node(arr[0]);
    Node* prev = head;
    for(int i = 1;i<arr.size();i++){
        Node* temp = new Node(arr[i],nullptr,prev);
        prev->next = temp;
        prev = temp;
    }
    return head;
}
Deleting head of a Doubly Linked List :
When the DLL has many elements we need to move head to 2nd element and segregate the first element by moving 
its next to null and its back is always pointing to null.
code:
Node* deleteHead(Node* head){
    if(head == NULL || head->next == NULL){
        return NULL;
    }
    Node * prev = head ; //creating a Node to store head of the DLL.
    head = head -> next ; //sending head to 2nd element
    head -> back = nullptr; //the back of islolated element is pointing to null
    prev -> next = nullptr; // the next of islolated element is pointing to null
    free(prev);// delete the isolated element.
    return head;
}
Deleting tail of DOubly Linked List:
Traverse till the tail of DLL.
pseudocode:
tail = head ;
while(tail->next!=NULL){
  tail = tail->next;
}
prev = tail->back;
prev->next = nullptr;
tail->back = nullptr;
free(tail);

code :
Node* DeleteTail(Node* head) {
    if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) {
        // If the list is empty or has only one node, return NULL
        if (head != NULL) {
            // If there's a single node, free it
            delete head;  // Assuming nodes are allocated with 'new'
        }
        return NULL;
    }

    // Traverse to the second-to-last node
    Node* tail = head;
    while (tail->next->next != NULL) {
        tail = tail->next;
    }

    // Now 'tail' points to the second-to-last node
    Node* lastNode = tail->next;  // The node to delete

    // Update the second-to-last node to be the new tail
    tail->next = NULL;

    // Free the memory of the last node
    delete lastNode;  // Assuming nodes are allocated with 'new'

    // Return the head of the list
    return head;
}
Deleting Kth Element of DLL:
Case 1 : 
has a next element but no previous element 
Case 2:
has next as well as previous element.
Case 3:
for k = n, no next element but has previous element.
          --
       cnt = 0;
       temp = head;
         while(temp!=NULL){
          c++;
          if(cnt == k) break;
          temp = temp-> next;
       }
After we have traversed to the element :
Now temp is standing at kth node.
Now lets take prev to a node before k.
and front to a node after k 
Prev = temp->back;
front = temp->next;
case if there's no front and back,
if(prev == NULL && front == NULL)
else if(prev == NULL)//It means we are at head.
delete head;
else if(front == NULL)//it means we are at last element.
Case 2:
 prev temp front
 now , prev's next should be pointing at front and front's back should be pointing at prev.
prev->next = front
front->back = prev
temp->next = nullptr;
temp->back - nullptr;
delete(temp);

code :
Node* DeleteKthElement(Node* head,int k){
    if(head == NULL){
        return NULL;
    }
    int cnt = 0;
    Node* kNode = head;
    while(kNode != NULL){
        cnt++;
        if(cnt == k) break;
        kNode = kNode->next;
    }
    Node* prev = kNode->back;
    Node* front = kNode->next;
    if(prev == NULL && front == NULL){
        return NULL;
    }
    else if(prev == NULL){
        deleteHead(head);
    }
    else if(front == NULL){
        return DeleteTail(head);
    }
    prev->next  = front;
    front->back = prev;
    kNode->next = nullptr;
    kNode->back = nullptr;
    delete(kNode);
    return head;
}

 INSERTION OF ELEMENT IN DOUBLY LINKED LIST :
 element before head :
code :
Node* InsertBeforeHead(Node* head,int val){
    Node* newHead = new Node(val,head,nullptr);
    head->back = newHead;
    return newHead;
}
