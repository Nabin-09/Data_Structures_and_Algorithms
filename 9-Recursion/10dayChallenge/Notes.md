# Recursion 
 
 When a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called Recursion.<br>

 Better Understanding : <br>
 If the solution of a big problem depends upon the small solution of same type of problem ,<br> we use recursion in such cases.<br>

 ## Basic terms : 

 ### Base Case :

 Where to stop recursion such as when finding a factorial we stop when n reaches 1 .<br> If we will not have a base case program will run into segmentation fault.(stack overflow).

 ### Recursive expression : 

 A recursive expression is a mathematical or logical formula that defines a value in terms<br>of itself, usually with a basecase to stop the recursion. <br>
 such as for Factorial it is : <br>
 n . f(n-1)
<br>
